This system presents users with a novel approach to enhancing typing proficiency through customized stories, each spanning one to three lines. During engagement with these stories, Type Evolve tracks a range of metrics including typing speed, accuracy, and both the nature and frequency of errors at the word and individual key levels. Upon completing each story, users are provided with a summary of these metrics, accompanied by a keyboard heat map. This heat map graphically depicts challenging areas, emphasizing both frequently missed target keys and incorrect key presses. Users can then choose to generate a new prompt, where the collected metrics are injected into customized instruction which are subsequently fed through state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) that powers Type Evolve. The generated output is a customized prompt that is tailored to address deficiencies in the user's prior performance. In a unique application of natural language processing (NLP) technology, Type Evolve employs an optimized large.
